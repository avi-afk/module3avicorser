          <h2>PANEER</h2>
              If you’re a cheese lover, this one’s for you! In Indian culture, it’s common to be a vegetarian or vegan, and whether you are or not, you’ve probably at least heard of Paneer.

In this post, we’re covering everything you need to know about what is Paneer, including how to make it, where to find it, and other important factors.
Paneer is an Indian cheese that’s made from curdled milk and some sort of fruit or vegetable acid like lemon juice. There are some distinct traits that make Paneer the cheese that it is: <br>

It’s an unaged cheese<br>
It’s a soft cheese<br>
It doesn’t melt<br>
You can eat paneer as a snack, with a meal, or even for breakfast. And while cheese might not seem like a common breakfast item, don’t knock it until you’ve tried it!

There are different theories as to where Paneer originated, the oldest and most common of them dating back to the 16th century in Southeast Asia where Persian and Afghani rulers first introduced the cheese. No matter its origin, it’s no secret that Paneer is a big and tasty part of the Indian culture. 
The great news about Paneer is that you can make it yourself at home if you’re feeling up to some homemade cheese. Perhaps the best part about making Paneer at home is that the ingredients and items necessary are so simple. You’d need whole milk, a cheesecloth, and lemon juice — that’s it! You’ll have delicious Indian cheese in under one hour. <br>

In this recipe from The Food Network, you line your colander with a large double layer of cheesecloth and set it in the sink. Then, bring 8 cups of whole milk to a gentle boil over medium heat while stirring. Once that happens, add in your lemon juice and turn the heat to low. While stirring, the curds will start forming! Remove from heat and pour contents into your lined colander and rinse with cold water. Take the cheesecloth in hand and squeeze out the excess liquid. Then tie it to your faucet to let the remaining liquid drain. After that, twist the ball tight and place another plate on top and weigh it down with a heavy pot to ensure smooth cheese. Refrigerate it like this for about 20 minutes and then enjoy!<br>
Not up for making your own cheese? No problem — you can buy Paneer from a number of places. Of course, your local Indian grocer is the first option to find Paneer as they will most likely always have one or two brands of the cheese available for purchase. If you don’t have an Indian grocer nearby, there are some other options where you can buy Paneer! You can usually find Paneer locally at your Aldi store or even online on Amazon. 

it may seem surprising that India has an indigenous cheese product when most other Asian countries like China do not – but it makes sense when you consider the strong tradition of raising cattle on the subcontinent, and the presence of other dairy products like ghee and lassi.

Modern cheesemaking in India traces back to the Indus Valley Civilization, which curdled milk with a special variety of green leaves, berries, barks, and yogurt. However, the Aryan people who invaded the region believed that curdling cow’s milk was dishonorable, and put a stop to this practice. This is because the cow was held to be sacred, and “spoiling” its milk, which was held at the top of the Ayurveda food hierarchy, was seen as a taboo.

Modern paneer is usually traced back to the Persian and Afghan rulers who introduced it in the 16th century, primarily in North India, where it was made with either goat or sheep rennet. The term “paneer” comes from the word “peynir,” which just means “cheese” in the Turkish and Persian Languages.

Today’s method of making paneer, which involves “breaking” milk with an acid like lemon juice, may have been introduced by the Portuguese in Bengal in the 17th century – and this is when cheeses like paneer and chhena first entered their modern forms.
