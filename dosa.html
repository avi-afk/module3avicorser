          <h2>DOSA</h2>
              In its most simple form, Dosa is very similar to a crepe and is a very popular street food in India. Dosa is famous for its simple ingredients, interesting flavors, and even its sweet aroma. I love it for how easy and clean the ingredients are. It can be eaten as a snack, as breakfast, or really anytime you’re in the mood! 

Originating in southern India, Dosa has been around since the 5th century AD. It’s said that Dosa was first referenced by Chalukya King Somesvara III in Tamil literature in 1054 AD. Like many Indian foods, Dosa has many different variations depending on region and occasion.  
Once you’ve cooked Dosa, I’ve found that it’s best if you serve it up hot! Since Dosa is typically a street food, it’s easy to take and eat on the go. In fact, it’s customary in the Indian culture to eat Dosa with your hands! I like to tear it off and eat it in small bites. If it’s served with a dip or chutney, you can tear pieces off and dunk it into the dip or sauce before eating, or you can leave it whole and dip as you go! 

If it’s served with masala, I like to wrap the Dosa around some of the masala and eat it like a mini sandwich. I have a favorite “dosa masala” recipe that I have to share with you because without it this post on dosa can just not be complete. It’s a simple recipe of spiced potatoes that are very similar to the rustic breakfast hash we serve so often with an American breakfast. Only these potatoes have all Indian flavors but you sure can enjoy it as your “American breakfast hash”. 

So back to the ways of serving your dosa.. If it’s served with chutney, you can use a knife to spread some over your Dosa and eat it bit by bit. No matter how you eat your Dosa, make sure you enjoy every bite!

A dosa is a thin, spicy, crispy crêpe-like food made from fermented rice, very popular in restaurants in South India. It may be served plain with sambar and chutneys such as coconut chutney (as pictured), or other curry or gravy. When served with potato folded inside, it is known as masala dosa. To make omelette dosa, simply pour beaten egg on the dosa before it is turned over.

The procedure for making dosa starts out almost identical to that for making idli. The idli recipe in this cookbook has some very good tips and variations that apply equally to dosai.
Dosa can easily be made on a tava, iron frying pan or non-stick pan. Heat the pan on a medium heat until a drop of water evaporates on contact. Spread about 1/2 cup of batter on the pan (like pancakes) slowing spreading it outwards forming a thin, circular dosa. Allow it to cook for a minute and using a flat spatula, flip it over for the other side to cook. As the other side cooks spread a layer of ghee-shortening mixture on the topside. Flip it over again. As the bottom crisps add a teaspoon of onion chutney on the top and spread it evenly. Add some of the filling onto one half of the dosa and fold the other side over. Serve with coconut chutney.
Let me tell you a bit about Dosas. Originally from the Southeastern parts of India, Dosa was originally called Dosai in the Tamil language.

In India, Dosa is consumed as a breakfast even though most restaurants in North America serve it for lunch or dinner. Surprised? Well, did you know that Samosas are also mainly consumed for breakfast and as snacks in India? While I was in India crawling the streets of Old Dehli taking pictures, I could see Indian workers, lifters, drivers, cleaners, shop owners having early breakfast with Samosas. I tried it myself for 15 roupies ($30 cents) thinking that it is cheap enough for 1, but I got two. Can you imagine two samosas for 30 cents (Canadian dollars)? They were delicious with a spicy kick I will never forget.
